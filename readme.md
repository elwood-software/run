```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https:/x.elwood.run/schema@latest.json

name: hello-world
jobs:
  echo:

      # standard output
      - run: echo "Hello, World!"
        description: "Prints 'Hello, World!' to stdout."

      # We can do the same thing with the "echo" action
      # You an check out the echo action in ../actions/echo.ts
