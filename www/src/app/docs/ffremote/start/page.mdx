};

# Getting Started

## 1. Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elwood.run/ffremote/install.sh | sh
```

The install script will not add ffr to your PATH so you'll need to do that
yourself. Here's an example of how you might add ffr to your PATH:

```bash
 # for bash
 echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.elwood/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

 # for zsh
 echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.elwood/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile
```

## 2. Start a Job

```bash
ffremote -i "test.mov" -t 30 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental "test.mp4"
```

Before the job is submitted, you'll be prompted to open a browser to
authenticate on <a href="https://elwood.run">elwood.run</a>. You'll also need to setup a payment
method. Note: You will not be charged until the job is complete.

Once you've authenticated, <strong>ffremote</strong> will upload any of the '-i'
input files and submit your job. You'll receive a tracking ID that you can use
to check the status of your job.

```bash
Job Queued! Tracking ID: 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
Watch the process: ffremote watch 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
Download the result: ffremote get 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```

Jobs are queued as a remote server is created. Once the server is created,
your job .

## 3. Check Job Status

```bash
ffremote status 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```
