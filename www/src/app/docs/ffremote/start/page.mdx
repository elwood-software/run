# Getting Started

## 1. Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elwood.run/ffremote/install.sh | sh
```

The [install script](https://github.com/elwood-software/run/blob/main/install-ffr.sh) will not add `ffremote` to your `$PATH` so you'll need to do that
yourself. Here's an example of how you might add `ffremote` to your `$PATH`:

```bash
 # for bash
 echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.elwood/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
 # for zsh
 echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.elwood/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile
```

## 2. Start an Execution

```bash
ffremote -ss 00:00:12 -i "https://elwood.run/bunny.mov" -t 00:00:48 -vf "fade=t=in:st=0:d=5,fade=t=out:st=43:d=5" -af "afade=t=in:st=0:d=5,afade=t=out:st=43:d=5" output.mp4
```

The command will extract 48 seconds, starting at 12 second, from "bunny.mov" while adding five second audio and video fade in and out.

Before the execution is submitted, you'll be prompted to open a browser to
authenticate on <a href="https://elwood.run">elwood.run</a>. You'll also need to setup a subscription & payment
method before your execution begins. Note: You will not be charged until the execution is complete.

`ffremote` will parse the ffmpeg args provided and upload any local files defined in `-i` flags. `-i` can also be a remote URL, as in the example above. If you have sidecar files that are used in your command, but are not input files, use the `--include` option to make those files available to the execution.

You'll receive a tracking ID that you can use to check the status of your execution.

```bash
Execution Queued! Tracking ID: 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
Watch the process: ffremote watch 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
Download the result: ffremote get 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```

Executiuons are queued while a remote worker is built. Once the worker is created,
your execution will begin.

## 3. Check Job Status

At any point in the process, you can check the status of your execution. You can leave off the `<tracking-id>` to view the status of the last execution queued.

```bash
ffremote status 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```

Full [status](/docs/ffremote/reference/cli/#status) documentation.

## 4. Watch the Logs

While the execution is in process, you can use the `watch` command to view any outputs from the remote `ffmpeg` process. Once the execution is complete, the full logs will be output.

```bash
ffremote watch 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```

Full [watch](/docs/ffremote/reference/cli/#watch) documentation.

## 5. Download the Results

Once the execution has finished successfully, you can use the `get` command to download the results of the execution. Any files that your `ffmpeg` command generated will be included in the output, as well as a `ffremote-output.txt` file that contains all of the `stdout` & `stderr` of the execution.

```bash
ffremote get 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```

Full [get](/docs/ffremote/reference/cli/#get) documentation.

## Bonus: Latency-Tolerant High-Quality Transcoding

```bash
ffremote -- -y -vsync 0 -hwaccel_output_format cuda -i "https://elwood.run/bunny.mov" -c:a copy -c:v h264_nvenc -preset p6 -tune hq -b:v 5M -bufsize 5M -maxrate 10M -qmin 0 -g 250 -bf 3 -b_ref_mode middle -temporal-aq 1 -rc-lookahead 20 -i_qfactor 0.75 -b_qfactor 1.1 output.mp4
```
