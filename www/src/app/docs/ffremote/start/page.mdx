# Getting Started

## 1. Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elwood.run/ffremote/install.sh | sh
```

The [install script](https://github.com/elwood-software/run/blob/main/install-ffr.sh) will not add `ffremote` to your `$PATH` so you'll need to do that
yourself. Here's an example of how you might add `ffremote` to your `$PATH`:

```bash
 # for bash
 echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.elwood/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

 # for zsh
 echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.elwood/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile
```

## 2. Start an Execution

```bash
ffremote -i "test.mov" -t 30 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental "test.mp4"
```

Before the execution is submitted, you'll be prompted to open a browser to
authenticate on <a href="https://elwood.run">elwood.run</a>. You'll also need to setup a subscription & payment
method before your execution begins. Note: You will not be charged until the execution is complete.

Once you've authenticated, `ffremote` will upload any of the '-i'
input files. You can use `--include` to upload additional files. You'll receive a tracking ID that you can use
to check the status of your execution.

```bash
Execution Queued! Tracking ID: 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
Watch the process: ffremote watch 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
Download the result: ffremote get 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```

Executiuons are queued while a remote worker is built. Once the worker is created,
your execution will begin.

## 3. Check Job Status

At any point in the process, you can check the status of your execution. You can leave off the `<tracking-id>` to view the status of the last execution queued.

```bash
ffremote status 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```

Full [status](/docs/ffremote/reference/cli/#status) documentation.

## 4. Watch the Logs

While the execution is in process, you can use the `watch` command to view any outputs from the remote `ffmpeg` process. Once the execution is complete, the full logs will be output.

```bash
ffremote watch 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```

## 5. Download the Results

Once the execution has finished successfully, you can use the `get` command to download the results of the execution. Any files that your `ffmpeg` command generated will be included in the output, as well as a `ffremote-output.txt` file that contains all of the `stdout` & `stderr` of the execution.

```bash
ffremote get 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
```
