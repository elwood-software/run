# Getting Started

<section>
## 1. Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elwood.run/ffr/install.sh | sh
```

<p>
  The install script will not add ffr to your PATH so you'll need to do that
  yourself
</p>

```bash
 echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.elwood/run/bin/ffr' >> ~/.bashrc
 echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.elwood/run/bin/ffr' >> ~/.zprofile
```

## 2. Start a Job

```bash
ffr -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4
```

<p>
  Before the job is submitted, you'll be prompted to open a browser to
  authenticate on <a href="">elwood.run</a>. You'll also need to setup a payment
  method. Note: You will not be charged until the job is complete.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've authenticated, <strong>ffr</strong> will upload any of the '-i'
  input files and submit your job. You'll receive a tracking ID that you can use
  to check the status of your job.
</p>

```bash
Job Queued! Tracking ID: 6b5337db-3038-425f-acd8-26a16c564ff9
