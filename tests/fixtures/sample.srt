00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi, my name is Ron Howard and I feel, frankly indifferent about being Conan O'Brien's friend.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You know what, and no one says this often, but Ron Howard, you prick.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can tell that we are going to be friends. I can tell that we are going to be friends.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello there and welcome to Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I wanted to start out a little different, so I went with hello there and that might become a thing.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, like a Midwestern DJ from the 50s.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello there.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's cool.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, that's cool.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's really cool.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's cool.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, the cool bar here is exceedingly low, joined by my compatriots, my Confederates, compadres, co-owners.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Are we co-owners?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I have staked this thing?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, no, no, not this.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, no, no.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, no, I bought a 1954 Nash Rambler and we're co-owners.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am satisfied.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, it's an old kind of car.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Can you just do a different car that I would know?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yellow.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's Sonam of Sessian and yellow.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Matt Gorley, Sona, I just had a very nice experience.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I had to go into a jewelry store to have one of my many chain pendants repaired.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why do you have so many chain pendants?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because Mr. T sends me one like once a year.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, that's cool.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And then I feel like, yeah.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't carry ownership of that.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So, no, I had to have something fixed a little bit and I went in there and they were immediately

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
like, Conan, and it's all because of you.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Because they're Armenian and they Sona is a hero.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I think you're kind of discounting how big I am in the Armenian community.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, are we?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, they did say, where is Fussy Man?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Which is Armenian for coolest dude ever.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, of course.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, I just look at my posture.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Anyway, we had a nice exchange.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They were very happy that I went to Armenia with you.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That is the gift that keeps on giving.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, in LA especially, to have street cred with the Armenians, you're in.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Eduardo is nodding a lot.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Eduardo, your wife is Armenian, am I correct?

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, Vonses.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Check him out.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What do you mean, check him out?

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He said, how are you?

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, Vonses.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, I thought you said her name was Vonses.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, her name's Eza, but.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, I know.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When you said Vonses, everyone listening just assumed that was her name.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Except for Armenian fans.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, of which we have a lot of...

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Of which there are two and they work at a jewelry store right up the street.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Vonses, yeah.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But he said...

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I said Brev and he said inch per second.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I said Lavam and he went, whoa.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, so that's him.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's not keep it pushing.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes, yes.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Greba, Greba.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't do that.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why?

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't do your fake Armenian.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're doing so well.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And it's just a matter of time before you...

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Matt didn't know it was fake.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And I'm fluent.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And you do say every now and then, I hit a real word accidentally.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, I don't.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Greba Stabi?

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Not at all.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Khosh.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Khosh.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah.

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What dialect do you speak?

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I speak...

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's important.

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't like that.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I almost fell for it.

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you even know that you asked a real question?

92
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh.

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, you don't.

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You say too.

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I speak Western dialect.

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, I always assume that.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm a gorgor gorgor gorgor.

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, come on.

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We say gorgor.

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, that's a trick.

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, gorgor gorgor gorgor.

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes, yes.

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Gorgor gorgor gorgor.

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Anyway, I'm in...

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think I'm doing well in the Armenian community.

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And I think if we go community by community,

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
eventually it will have everybody under our tent.

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Did they hook you up?

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Can I go there and get some shit for free?

111
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They did hook me up.

113
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They gave me six pounds of dried apricot.

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's rolled up like a carpet.

115
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Khosh.

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, khosh.

117
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's dried up like a carpet.

118
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, you remember when you and I went,

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that's what they kept giving us,

120
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
was dried apricot and dried pomegranate.

121
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, they gave us one.

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And it was very good.

123
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Dried fruit.

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I said, you know what?

125
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Fruit roll up.

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

127
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And they said, why are you speaking in that crazy way?

128
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I said, I'm doing a comedy character.

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And this is a fruit roll up.

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And remember then they said,

133
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
you need to leave Armenia immediately?

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, they did.

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They almost kicked us out of the country.

136
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And they also were like, that's not funny,

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
even if we understood what you were doing.

138
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They said we understand the reference now

139
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and it's still not funny.

140
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes.

141
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

143
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I said, yeah, you could fool me

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
because this looks like a fruit roll up.

145
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You doubled down.

146
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't double down.

147
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
By now it's quadrupled down

148
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
because I think I'm on the fourth go around

149
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
of fruit roll up.

150
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But we had a nice bond.

151
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's nice.

152
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And so I do sincerely thank you

153
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
for hooking me up in the Armenian community.

154
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They're very nice people.

155
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, you know what?

156
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I mean, this is sincere.

157
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It was your idea to go there

158
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and that always meant a lot to me.

159
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So thank you for taking me to Armenia.

160
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, of course.

161
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It was cool.

162
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Free trips are the best trips.

163
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Also, it was your homeland.

164
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, that's right.

165
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It wasn't a Vegas U-turn, you know.

167
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And what is your...

168
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What would you consider your ancestral homeland, Matt?

169
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Would it be Scotland?

170
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I always thought it was Irish,

171
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
then learned it was definitely Scots-Irish,

172
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but now I think I'm mostly English.

173
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So let's just go hit all three.

174
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You and me, huh, buddy?

175
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know what?

176
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm up for it.

177
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
OK.

178
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So you went on this trip?

179
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah.

180
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

181
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're paying?

182
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, it's not going to be me that's paying.

183
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're going to find a sponsor.

184
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, OK.

185
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
OK.

186
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll totally go for reals.

187
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

188
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We're going to get solo stove to back this.

189
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do we have to use the solo stove on the plane?

190
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

191
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We have to fly a plane that's made of solo stoves.

192
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They're all welded together.

193
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And the plane is constantly on fire,

194
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
but there's no smoke.

195
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

196
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And it's kind of a jet turbine.

197
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Exactly.

198
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So...

199
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You point it the right way.

200
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No, that's my idea that I've had for a while,

201
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and I think I've mentioned this,

202
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I just start talking up a product a lot.

203
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now, we happen to have a relationship with solo stove.

204
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They're not paying for this mention right now.

205
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is a freebie for you guys.

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Shout out to solo stove.

207
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But I do think we should start talking about products

208
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that we don't have a connection to.

209
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Agreed.

210
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then we'll get into bed with them.

211
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah.

212
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I mean, like Apple.

213
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Where is the Apple band?

214
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Right.

215
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Right.

216
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Apple is a huge company,

217
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and this is a cool podcast.

218
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Adam, you're...

219
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And they need to advertise.

220
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah.

221
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

222
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because you know what?

223
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Even hardcore Apple fans,

224
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
if they aren't made aware

225
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

226
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that there's a new Apple phone somehow

227
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
through advertising or something,

228
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
they're not going to know.

229
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I need to buy a new desktop.

230
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll wait.

231
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

232
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think,

233
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
why don't you do a preemptive Apple read right now?

234
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That'll let them know

235
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
that you really care about the product.

236
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah.

237
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know, I love Apple,

238
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and I always have.

239
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Uh-huh.

240
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because,

241
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
well, Apple just gets the job done,

242
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you know,

243
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
get her done.

244
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait, that's not good.

245
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

246
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Someone else knows that.

247
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is a good...

248
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It does work because that's Larry the Cable Guy

249
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
on Cars,

250
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
who's a Pixar,

251
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
which is owned by Apple.

252
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

253
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No one else made that connection, though.

254
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

255
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He just sound like he was having a breakdown.

256
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, he meant to do that.

257
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He's the rain man of useless information.

258
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's true.

259
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So, no, but what I believe is that,

260
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
look, look,

261
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm just going to say it,

262
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you know,

263
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I got the Apple Watch,

264
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I use the Apple phone,

265
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
known as the iPhone to many fans.

266
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

267
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And...

268
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't see the Apple Watch on your wrist right now.

269
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Are you trying to help or not?

270
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I wear it when I'm exercising.

271
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're wearing it somewhere else.

272
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Can I tell you something else?

273
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes.

274
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes.

275
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They make a special one

276
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
for other regions of the body,

277
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and we just lost Apple.

278
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh.

279
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Nice call.

280
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You know who we have?

281
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Samsung.

282
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And Samsung is great.

283
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You know, Samsung is great.

284
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Do we really have Samsung?

285
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, we have Samsung.

286
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why are we doing an Apple commercial?

287
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I thought about that halfway through

288
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Conan's Apple read,

289
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and I got it.

290
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Can I say something?

291
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Bad move.

292
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Can I say something?

293
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Can I just say something?

294
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let me just riff off the top.

295
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is just...

296
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I just had this thought.

297
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Fuck Apple.

298
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

299
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You know what I mean?

300
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm not buying a new desktop.

301
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm buying a new Samsung frame TV.

302
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And guess what?

303
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll tell you something else.

304
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is why I should have been talking

305
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
about Samsung.

306
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't even...

307
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
By the way,

308
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
does anyone use an Apple phone

309
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
or is it called an Apple phone

310
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
or is it if phone or iPhone?

311
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think it's if phone, right?

312
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Everyone calls it an Apple phone.

313
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Everyone does.

314
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Anyway.

315
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Keep saying it.

316
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Those...

317
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I mean,

318
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
it just seems like a badly run company

319
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
with a product no one cares about.

320
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

321
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Here's the thing.

322
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Samsung,

323
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I mean,

324
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've been on the Samsung channel

325
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
on the Samsung TVs,

326
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and it just plays me.

327
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is my wet dream

328
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
all my life.

329
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, I'm sorry.

330
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
By wet dream,

331
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I didn't mean anything gross.

332
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I meant a dream that I would have at night

333
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that would make me come.

334
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, come on.

335
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Samsung, are you listening?

336
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

337
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So,

338
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I guess I did mean what you thought I meant.

339
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's definitely what I thought.

340
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So anyway,

341
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
it's this channel.

342
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Have you watched the Conan Channel?

343
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I only watched it.

344
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's fantastic.

345
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, it's amazing.

346
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sometimes my wife is saying,

347
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
oh, you know,

348
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I hear show guns really good.

349
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And I'm like,

350
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
who wants that later?

351
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
More!

352
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And her,

353
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
she's crying and her,

354
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
she wears a lot of mascara,

355
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
as you know,

356
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and it's just running.

357
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's a classic life.

358
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She's a big guy.

359
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah.

360
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's running down her face

361
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
like Tammy Faye Baker.

362
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And she's like,

363
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I just heard show guns.

364
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And quiet!

365
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is me in 98.

366
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm killing it!

367
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Killing it!

368
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So,

369
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
yeah,

370
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Samsung gets it done.

371
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then I guess is,

372
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
what happened to Apple?

373
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They kind of fell apart to them in the late 90s.

374
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
While we were talking,

375
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
they went bankrupt.

376
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's what I'm told.

377
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We have that much kind of power.

378
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And when I said that much kind of power,

379
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
that's not a real sentence.

380
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That much kind.

381
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That much kind.

382
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If I catch myself before you do,

383
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
that's not a problem.

384
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey,

385
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going to wrap it up right now.

386
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I just want to say,

387
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
yellow to all our listeners.

388
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And remember,

389
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Samsung's the way to go.

390
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And if you need a phone,

391
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't know,

392
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I wouldn't waste my money.

393
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

394
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And they do everything.

395
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What?

396
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Appliances.

397
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Who are we talking about now?

398
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I thought you were talking about Apple.

399
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Apple doesn't do shit.

400
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

401
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now you're going too far.

402
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What if they're about to buy in?

403
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, yeah.

404
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What did you think about that?

405
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah.

406
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I think we should leave the door open.

407
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't leave the door open to crack.

408
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

409
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And say,

410
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think they do make a fine product.

411
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh.

412
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And we love Samsung.

413
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We love Samsung.

414
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We love Samsung.

415
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But, you know,

416
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
why isn't there room in this world for both?

417
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know what that voice is.

418
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's a good yellow for all of you.

419
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And,

420
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Bontas.

421
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What'd you say to me?

422
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Bontas.

423
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hosh.

424
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah.

425
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And I can't wait to meet her.

426
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't wait to meet your wife.

427
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll be like,

428
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Vonses, you're more beautiful than I thought.

429
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And she'll be like,

430
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
what are you talking about?

431
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why are you saying you're more beautiful than I thought?

432
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Eduardo's wife.

433
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

434
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.

435
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Because I...

436
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You think the Vonses is weird.

437
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You know what?

438
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're way more beautiful than I thought.

439
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That is my...

440
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know what?

441
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I've been saying that...

442
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There's so many layers.

443
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I've been saying that to women for so many years.

444
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And I have to say it,

445
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
not getting a good reaction.

446
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No.

447
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
No.

448
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So many times,

449
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I say to women,

450
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
you know,

451
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
people bring their spouses by and they go,

452
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
oh, you're so much more beautiful than I thought.

453
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And it's weird.

454
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're essentially saying,

455
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I thought you were ugly.

456
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

457
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Prior to seeing you.

458
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah.

459
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

460
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And it also implies,

461
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm thinking about you a lot.

462
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes.

463
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And think of you as ugly.

464
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Right.

465
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Hey, would you do me a favor, Eduardo?

466
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah.

467
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Tell Vonses.

468
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Tell Vonses,

469
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm very sorry for what I said,

470
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and I didn't mean it.

471
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I can't wait to meet Vonses.

472
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Keep her away from him.

473
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
All right.

474
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We got to get into it.

475
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And what a show we have today.

476
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What a show we have today.

477
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
My guest on the podcast is an Academy Award winning director

478
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
of such movies as Apollo 13,

479
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
a beautiful mind and night shift.

480
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He now has a new documentary on Disney Plus

481
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
called Jim Henson Idea Man.

482
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And it is a must.

483
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Ron Howard, welcome.

484
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You have this reputation of being like,

485
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
oh, he's the nicest guy.

486
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And then you come in here and you take me off.

487
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, I can take it or leave it.

488
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah.

489
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

490
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm here.

491
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But I'm here.

492
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm here.

493
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
To be honest, you really could.

494
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean, I was shocked you showed up.

495
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You've had a level of success.

496
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Frankly, I'm surprised when anyone shows up.

497
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But you've had a level of success where, yeah,

498
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
you do not need to be here and I'm appreciative that you're here.

499
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No, I actually do.

500
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I've always loved conversations with you.

501
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Going back to your rookie year on TV.

502
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You came on.

503
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You were one of the early people to come on the show

504
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and you agreed to do a bit.

505
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No one knew who I was and we were trying very,

506
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
very out there bits.

507
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And we said, what we want to do is we want to saw your arm off.

508
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And you said, OK.

509
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And we did a bit where you had a stunt arm

510
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and at one point we're talking and I just take out a saw

511
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and I saw your arm off and you're screaming.

512
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And you were fantastic.

513
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And of course, most people didn't know who I was.

514
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You were, you know, you've been iconic since, I don't know, 1965.

515
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And beloved.

516
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And so people I remember this is back when people would write in with

517
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
complaints, but people were saying the way you treated Ron Howard.

518
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I didn't really saw his arm off.

519
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I love that.

520
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hey, a funny redhead.

521
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There you go.

522
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
OK.

523
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I have a very clear distinct memory of getting invited to some event.

524
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know what it was.

525
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Maybe it was like a vanity fair party, something that where I would

526
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
feel a little bit out of place thinking, do I belong here?

527
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And I'm with my wife and I get they see me at a table with you

528
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and your wife and a couple of other people, but we're all right next

529
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
to each other.

530
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And then you and I start to get into this very intense conversation.

531
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I remember people at the table thinking, wow, what's we're

532
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
talking about?

533
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's really intense.

534
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Like are they talking about film?

535
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What are they talking about?

536
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
My wife leaned over and she listened.

537
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And then she said to the rest of the group, sunblock.

538
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And it was true.

539
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It was true.

540
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And I was and you were saying like, yeah, no, no, here's what I do.

541
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I always try and wear a hat.

542
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But you know, it's got to be at least a 45.

543
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And I was like, yeah, but is there zinc in there?

544
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And you're like, here's the deal.

545
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Can be problematic.

546
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And we went we went really deep.

547
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And then and of course your your wife was like, yeah.

548
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, my wife's a redhead.

549
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes.

550
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Your color.

551
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes.

552
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Vivid redhead.

553
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And same as Bryce.

554
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
When Bryce was our firstborn, the first time that we took her in,

555
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
we went to the dermatologist, Cheryl and I, and brought Bryce and Bryce

556
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
was literally in our arms.

557
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So she was maybe maybe a year old.

558
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

559
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And the dermatologist, you know, gives us each our checkup and so

560
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
forth.

561
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And then he and then he says, you know, you're gonna, you're gonna

562
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
have to keep a hat on her.

563
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're gonna have to keep her.

564
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And and then he looked at Cheryl and looked at me and he said, you know,

565
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
she's very pale.

566
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She's pale.

567
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, we know.

568
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He said, you're not going to have any more kids.

569
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Are you?

570
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh my God.

571
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He meant it.

572
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh my God.

573
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah.

574
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah.

575
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh my God.

576
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I remember distinctly having a conversation with the dermatologist

577
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
once where he said, OK, OK, this is when I'm in my 30s.

578
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And he went, OK, OK, I mean, but look at the freckling you have the

579
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
sun damage.

580
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And I went, well, yeah, I've, you know, and he said, well, do you do some

581
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
luck?

582
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And I said, yeah.

583
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And he said, you were a hat.

584
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah.

585
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Do you wear long shirts?

586
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah.

587
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
OK.

588
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But what about some days?

589
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Do you ever like walk?

590
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
How do you get from like the car to that?

591
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I said, you know what?

592
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I live on the planet Earth and there's nothing we can do about

593
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that because it has a son.

594
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So some son is going to get to me and it was like, well, it's your

595
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
death.

596
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's like they're afraid you're going to bring down the level of

597
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
life expectancy for their patients.

598
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They smirch their records.

599
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

600
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's going to lead to a lawsuit.

601
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You mentioned Bryce, who I adore.

602
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you.

603
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
She's a terrific talent, beautiful.

604
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You must be very proud of her.

605
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You told me that when she came on my show once, it was a very tense

606
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
moment for you.

607
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why?

608
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, I mean, I, you know, I'm a parent of adults.

609
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But, you know, that that that sort of constant worrying about your

610
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
kids is kind of, you know, it's kind of faded.

611
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't feel pretty confident about it.

612
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't have that.

613
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I never had.

614
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I just thought like, Hey, man, I'm in show business.

615
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I got to worry about myself.

616
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

617
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
These kids are on their own.

618
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, good for you.

619
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah.

620
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But you walk your path.

621
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah.

622
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Okay.

623
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay.

624
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But, but, but she said, I'm going to cry on demand on Conan show.

625
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And I said, Oh, come on, Bryce.

626
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And I've seen her do it.

627
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
She can cry, you know, she can cry on command and, and, and

628
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and I, and I said, but that's not, I mean, it's a show.

629
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's a live show.

630
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I mean, you know, it's, and she said, No, I'm going to do it.

631
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And, and, and so then she told me it worked.

632
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So I know that.

633
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And yet when I watched her on the show doing it, I was so edge of

634
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
my seat still.

635
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll tell you, I recommend if you get a second, check this out

636
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
because Bryce was on the, was on the show and she did this and it

637
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
was really, I think, I mean, I can't say this about my own show,

638
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
but it was a very cool moment of television because she said she

639
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
was going to do it.

640
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The whole audience gets very quiet and there's a process and you

641
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
can hear a pin drop.

642
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Right.

643
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
My heart's pounding because I'm thinking I'm the host of the show.

644
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I can only imagine.

645
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Failure is not that funny.

646
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

647
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I had, I had gotten used to it at that point, but, but I was, I was,

648
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and then it happens and it is you.

649
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It was a moment like, and I've heard about it from so many people.

650
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And when the tear finally rolled down, I was like, oh, everybody might

651
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
have been a Super Bowl touchdown.

652
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah.

653
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But I, but, but here's the thing about Bryson crying.

654
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Her first professional job, maybe not her first, her first time on

655
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Broadway was this Tartuffe, this classic show.

656
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And so here she is in this theater opening night.

657
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
She is sick, fever.

658
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We, her, Cheryl and I had to get her to the theater and we weren't

659
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
sure she was going to be able to even do the show, but of course

660
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
it's opening night.

661
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So she's doing it.

662
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And there's this scene where she's at her father's feet and begging

663
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
for something and she starts crying.

664
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And we're sitting in like the third row and it's, you know, it's theater

665
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
so people can fake cry and it kind of, but she's really crying.

666
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Tears are going down her face and it's just like an unbelievable

667
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
moment for me coming from a theatrical family and all that.

668
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I looked over and Cheryl's just kind of sitting with her arms

669
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
crossed kind of with a little smile on her face.

670
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
No emotion whatsoever.

671
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So we get to the intermission and I said, babe, weren't you knocked

672
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
out by that moment?

673
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I mean, you know, there she is.

674
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
She's got a fever.

675
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's opening night.

676
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
She's crying real tears on Broadway.

677
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And she said, are you kidding me?

678
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
She did that every day of her life when she was 17.

679
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Because she couldn't use the car.

680
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We've all seen that.

681
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You mentioned coming from this family.

682
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's really worth noting that your career improbable in so many ways

683
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
because just on Andy Griffith alone, you could have spent the rest

684
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
of your life setting up a card table and going to conventions

685
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
and having that amazing experience.

686
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And it's so funny because I'm around.

687
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I get to interview so many terrific actors talking to Walton

688
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Goggins the other day, talking to Billy Bob Thornton.

689
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Both of them cite the Andy Griffith show as being seminal for them.

690
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Amazing.

691
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And I think I understand it because it's character comedy.

692
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Not afraid of a long pause.

693
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Right.

694
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Not afraid of.

695
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And I was saying there are scenes outside the courthouse from the

696
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
courthouse shop that feel like waiting for Godot and beautiful.

697
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like it really does hold up.

698
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, it's, you know, it was so much a function of a kind of

699
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
singular creative voice, not that Andy wrote.

700
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He wasn't the, you know, he wasn't even didn't have a producer credit,

701
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but it was his show was tailored to his sensibility and Sheldon

702
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Leonard, the executive producer and very active on the on the show

703
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
was this old character actor who had become this incredible

704
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
television producer who had great success with Danny Thomas and Van

705
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Dyke and Andy Griffith show.

706
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And for a moment he was like the comedy producer, but he was there

707
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
all the time and they were always stressing character and Andy used

708
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
to kill jokes if they were if they were too broad.

709
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And and he just kept saying the South is plenty funny on its own

710
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
without having to reach for it and and and and and do slapstick

711
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and stuff, you know, and and and like he didn't like Petticoat

712
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Junction and Hillbilly.

713
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Not Hillbilly Elegy.

714
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's a movie I directed.

715
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He didn't like Beverly Hillbilly.

716
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Beverly Hillbilly.

717
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Right.

718
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And, you know, because they because, you know, they were doing

719
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
sketch basically.

720
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes.

721
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And and high concept.

722
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He didn't he didn't like Little Abner.

723
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You know, you see.

724
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And so as a result, I don't know that there's that there have been

725
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
other single camera shows that kind of held that tone.

726
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Maybe Real McCoy's a little bit, but they didn't have Don Knotts.

727
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes.

728
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You know, and and I was remarking recently that it's the ability

729
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
to have two characters just talking about that's a nice day.

730
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, those bits were usually when the show was short.

731
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yes.

732
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And they would come.

733
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So we would shoot Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

734
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Single camera.

735
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah.

736
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Rehearsed on 30 read on Thursday's.

737
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Rehearsed Fridays.

738
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Shoot Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

739
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And several times these scenes, the kinds that you're citing.

740
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yep.

741
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Usually between Don and Andy.

742
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yep.

743
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I remember vividly Aaron, Aaron Rubin, our showrunner coming down

744
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and saying, talking to Andy.

745
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And then and then Andy would he always called Don Jesse.

746
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah.

747
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And he was like, Jesse, we're short.

748
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Come on.

749
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And they and it's the very last thing of the end of the Wednesday

750
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
night shoot would be the two of them.

751
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And they would have just talked about it a little bit.

752
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And they'd wind up doing doing one of these one of these scenes.

753
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They're amazing.

754
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And it's just it.

755
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I love watching them because they're just playing the silences.

756
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And it's so well.

757
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And of course, you've got these two consummate beautiful actors.

758
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They're just such great comedic actors.

759
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But just, oh boy, it's a nice day.

760
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Sure is.

761
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Isn't it?

762
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yep.

763
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yep.

764
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yep.

765
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yep.

766
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yep.

767
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So watching it and you're thinking, I have this theory that comedy has been

768
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
increasingly compressed to the point now that when any series starts,

769
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
they have to start at the most dramatic moment and then that's a flash.

770
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That turns out it's a flashback because they can't start slowly.

771
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You might people can flip to another streaming platform too quickly.

772
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Right.

773
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So every show starts with main character has five bullet holes in them

774
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and is screaming and then you cut to two weeks earlier.

775
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah.

776
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And I think they don't trust us that this is going somewhere.

777
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Right.

778
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And there's a lot of parallel editing and everything.

779
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And just the idea that one of the most popular shows in television history

780
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
could often consist of people playing things in that pace.

781
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And the fact that the show really does endure.

782
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I mean, it's actually on like all the time and especially over COVID.

783
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I kept hearing from people that it was like a lifeline, you know, for them.

784
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But here's the thing.

785
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
How lucky was I to grow up in that situation where, in fact,

786
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the environment was set up for actors to not improvise,

787
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
but participate, make suggestions, things like that.

788
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And even as a six year old, I mean, my dad was having to read the lines

789
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
at the read through and I would just kind of sit there at first.

790
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
My father ran.

791
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But later, you know, when I started to learn to read and so forth,

792
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I was in it and I actually started occasionally making a suggestion

793
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and they'd never, you know, it never went anywhere.

794
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Kind of pissed me off a little bit in that first year.

795
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And I will never forget, it was the second episode of the second season

796
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and I had turned seven and we were rehearsing this scene

797
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
where I was supposed to come into the courthouse and Otis Halop Smith,

798
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Otis that was over here and Andy was there and Don was somewhere else.

799
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And I came in and I was supposed to say, hey, Pa, something, something,

800
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
whatever the line was.

801
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And then I sort of stopped the director, Bob Sweeney said, what is it, Ronnie?

802
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And I said, well, I don't think a kid would say it that way.

803
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, and he said, well, how do you think a kid would say it?

804
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't remember what the line was, but I would I pitched my little fix on it

805
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and he said, OK, good, yeah, do it do it that way.

806
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And it was just like I was a part of it.

807
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I just felt this surge of, you know, of being involved in something.

808
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And Andy from across said, what are you grinning at, young man?

809
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And I said, what's the first idea of mine you've taken?

810
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And he gave it the proper beat.

811
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And he said, well, it was the first one that was any damn good.

812
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Now let's rehearse the scene.

813
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Seven year old.

814
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But you know, it's also nice if you look at if you look at the history

815
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
of situation comedies, especially usually and increasingly so through

816
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the 70s and 80s and 90s, the kids role was to say something overly

817
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
sophisticated and wise ass, wise assy that a kid would never say.

818
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Right. So that's where you get all these, you know,

819
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
the Gary Coleman character that's just like, well, if you ask me,

820
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
it sounds like this guy's paying too many taxes.

821
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

822
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And I love that episode.

823
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I know.

824
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I agree with him.

825
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I think we are paying too many taxes.

826
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But and what I think really holds up well is your character is a real boy.

827
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
He's a you're playing your you're playing the reality of the situations.

828
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You're not saying, let me get this straight.

829
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah.

830
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, this is drunk again.

831
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Sounds like someone needs rehab.

832
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We can get the camera, which by the way, would have been a great line.

833
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But well, OK, this is something that that means a lot to me.

834
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And it was and I didn't know anything about it at the time.

835
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But later, Andy told me this.

836
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So when we were doing like a revival return to Mayberry or one of those

837
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
interview sort of, you know, specials or something.

838
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Andy told me this, that in that very first season, the first episode that my dad

839
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
was an actor, not a famous actor, but it was he was professional and working,

840
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
took it upon himself to just go up quietly to Andy at one point and say,

841
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
now, I see they're writing Opie kind of the way they write the Rusty Hamer

842
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
character on Danny Thomas and like so many shows where he's a wise ass.

843
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah.

844
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And he said that, you know, Ronnie can do that and everything.

845
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But what what if he actually respected his father and Andy thought about it

846
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and told me years later that he went back to the writers and said,

847
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
let's write let's write Andy Opie like like Ronnie Rance.

848
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh, wow.

849
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And yeah.

850
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And let's try that.

851
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And they went for it.

852
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah.

853
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, it stands out.

854
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
We've been fed a steady diet of everyone hates dad.

855
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Dad's an idiot.

856
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Right.

857
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And the kid knows it.

858
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And the kid knows it and is always letting him know it.

859
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And it got amped up, sometimes stretched out and kind of a meadow way,

860
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
like unmarried with children were, you know, there or sometimes the Simpsons

861
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
where they're actively plotting the father's death.

862
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That does make me laugh.

863
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It's effective.

864
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
No, no.

865
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's really funny.

866
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And I think the right way to go.

867
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
My point is your dad was wrong.

868
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And I don't think you should be here.

869
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's fascinating to me that you were part of that and you could have been

870
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
part of so many shows, but that one's different.

871
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yes.

872
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yes.

873
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Then you go from that.

874
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You're in film and then you start to think, you know what I think I'm doing

875
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and you want to you're interested in directing because you've been you're

876
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
around, you're watching directors.

877
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You're interested in it.

878
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And there's a job you take on a TV show and you think, well,

879
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
this probably won't get in the way of me going to film school.

880
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Right.

881
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Because what TV show lasts more than a pilot for a season.

882
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Right.

883
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And so you sign up for happy days.

884
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Correct.

885
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You idiot.

886
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Which now now, I mean, I mostly know Andy Griffith's show,

887
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Mayberry RFD from reruns, because I really come of age in the 70s.

888
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The thing is happy days.

889
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Like it's it's the it's suddenly the only show on TV that we all watch.

890
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Right.

891
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And you're just right there at the heart of this thing is juggernaut.

892
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And it was not the plan, right?

893
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
No, it wasn't really the plan.

894
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And and and also, of course, the course of the show, it evolved,

895
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
you know, as as as as Henry Winkler's character Fonzie took off.

896
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Right.

897
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You know, the whole show shifted.

898
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It was pretty thrilling to be around it.

899
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And we went from a solid show to sort of drifting like that we get

900
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
canceled to let's let's put Fonzie front and center and take advantage

901
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
of this. And then I think we became a number one show, even that first season

902
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
that we that we went in front of an audience, which was a huge education

903
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
for me, because I'd never done anything in front of people.

904
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And here we have this Gary Marshall, this great bunch of writers,

905
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Lowell Ganz among them who wound up writing with his partner, Bob Lomandel,

906
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
you know, Night Shift and Splash and all.

907
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So many other movies, League of their Own and City Slickers anyway.

908
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But suddenly it was about these hard laughs and that I had never really

909
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
been around that search, you know, Don Knott's would sometimes get there.

910
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But it was a more of a it was a general, you know, totally based on reality.

911
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I was terrified doing it, but I learned so much.

912
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And and Jerry Parris was this consummate comedy director.

913
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The Nate just just educate film nerds out I mean TV nerds out there.

914
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Jerry Parris was the neighbor on Andrew Griffith's show.

915
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I mean, on Dick Van Dyke. Right.

916
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And they and they had let him direct and found that he had this incredible gift.

917
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And he was a funny actor, but he was a brilliant comedy director.

918
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We had him for almost 95 percent of our episodes was was Jerry and he was

919
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
a ringleader and just tremendous and a great teacher.

920
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And and and suddenly, you know, I'm feeling the audience and I'm understanding

921
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
timing and all these kinds of things in a way that I never did before.

922
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Of course, Henry great stage actor Tom Bosley was on the show, you know.

923
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And when I finally get a chance to start directing comedy where we are going for laughs,

924
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
which is night shift and then Splash, I was so grateful to have in my head the kind

925
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
of the rhythms that I'd learned about, not from the Andy Griffith show, but from Happy Days.

926
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
One of the things I remember.

927
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I think the first time I saw it on happy was on Happy Days and then you later on

928
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
saw it more and more, but characters would enter.

929
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And, you know, first season of Happy Days, I remember was single camera.

930
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Right. And and shot more in this very filmic way.

931
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And then second season, you're in front of a studio audience.

932
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And then the show is becoming super popular, crazy popular.

933
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And so characters will enter and the audience will go crazy.

934
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Right. And so characters had to they're they're entering with important information

935
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
like there's a fire across the street.

936
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah. So.

937
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Ron, you'll enter.

938
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You'll enter the, you know, whatever the malt shop.

939
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And you'll be like, hey, hey, I don't want to go like, yeah.

940
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And you'll stand there.

941
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Right. Just take a pause.

942
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Because you can't talk and you're not and look around.

943
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And then you'll go and then what's finally when everyone dies down,

944
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
there's a fire across the street.

945
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And if you take the reality of it, there's something you're like a sociopath.

946
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Why didn't you tell everybody right away?

947
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
There's a fire.

948
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
My applause, man.

949
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah.

950
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, that was it.

951
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I mean, look, that that was part of the excitement was to take the,

952
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
you know, all all the the hysteria around Fonzie.

953
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yes.

954
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And put in front of the audience and, you know,

955
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and actually directly compete with J.J. Walker.

956
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

957
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Which is which is what times good times.

958
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And that's what they were.

959
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That's what they were going for.

960
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And and, you know, the same thing would happen with J.J. on that show.

961
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

962
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And so it was kind of a it was kind of a it was kind of a thing.

963
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Now, you know, I don't know.

964
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't have not watching a lot of audience sitcoms these days,

965
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
but I don't know whether I think most people,

966
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
they don't even shoot with an audience.

967
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I think they just they block and shoot.

968
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's so funny because tastes have changed.

969
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Times have changed so much.

970
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
That's I think we're in a golden age.

971
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I sometimes people to cry.

972
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh, TV these days.

973
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I agree.

974
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You know, you were talking about speed and density of comedy and so forth.

975
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And when we when we were beginning arrested development,

976
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Mitch Hurwitz and I talked a lot about the Simpsons.

977
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And part of that style was to create.

978
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I kept I kept saying a kind of density of laughs.

979
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah.

980
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And and I was a big proponent of that.

981
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And which kind of led to not only the the style,

982
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
which was sort of supposed to be originally much a little more faux

983
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
documentary than it wound up being.

984
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But, you know, I was pitching the idea of a narrator and Mitch said,

985
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I don't think we're going to need that.

986
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And we did it and so forth.

987
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You know, and he just he shot it and it was funny.

988
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But he said, you know, we should try it as an experiment.

989
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I kind of think you're on to something.

990
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So I was I was directing a movie in Santa Fe.

991
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And he said, would you just temp in the voice?

992
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And I so I did it literally in the sound truck.

993
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
We were on location in Santa Fe.

994
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I did it one lunch break for the pilot.

995
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Right.

996
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And so send it off.

997
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Didn't think much about it.

998
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
A couple of days later, Mitch called back and said, well,

999
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I have I have really good news and news that maybe is good or maybe not.

1000
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't know.

1001
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And I said, well, OK, well, give me the really good news first.

1002
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
He said the pilot tested really well.

1003
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah.

1004
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And I said, well, what's the what's the mixed news?

1005
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
He said, well, I just don't know how you're going to feel about it

1006
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
because the narrator tested the highest and now you have to do it.

1007
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
We sold the show, but I said you're doing it.

1008
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You're the narrator, but I love being part of that.

1009
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You know, it makes sense because my son and I watch, rewatch, rewatch

1010
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and rewatch arrest development all the time because he's got really good

1011
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
comedy taste.

1012
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm not so much to his liking, but he's but we'll watch it again and again

1013
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and again.

1014
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And what makes perfect sense to me, you know, when something's done,

1015
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
you just take it for granted that everything is the way it is.

1016
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Right.

1017
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So of course, it would never occur to me that you wouldn't be the narrator

1018
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
of arrest development.

1019
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And I think for my money, if you had to say like, OK, there's what are the

1020
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
what are the the absolute act me?

1021
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What's the height of television comedy?

1022
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And you can not one, but you can pick like five arrested developments

1023
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
in there.

1024
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The best of it is absolute perfection.

1025
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And I do think that people know you, they like you and they trust you

1026
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
your voice saying, meanwhile, Buster Buster had his own ideas.

1027
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And it's such a dense show.

1028
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Buster thinking he's in Mexico, although really he's only 10 miles

1029
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
from his house, sleeping at his housekeeper's residence.

1030
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's a constant.

1031
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You're being taken by the hand through this absolute madness.

1032
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And I don't think that show could exist without you there taking you along.

1033
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Thank you. It was really fun.

1034
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But whenever whenever I'd have an episode where I really had a lot of

1035
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
lines, I said, Mitch, you've been even even you've been struggling with this one.

1036
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You're looking for the narrator to bail you out, man.

1037
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Now, the reason that was funny is because when you found yourself reading lines

1038
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
like that,

1039
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Mitch bonafide comedy genius and that, you know, the and the cast that we

1040
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
assembled from from the first moment, it was like, you know, this is this is a

1041
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
little too good to be true.

1042
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I mean, it's just homerun hitters at every, you know, at every turn.

1043
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, it is absolute.

1044
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It is absolute perfection.

1045
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I can't watch it enough and it's still the go to if my son's had a hard day

1046
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
or I've had a hard day or we both had a hard day.

1047
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Well, OK, arrest development is still the go to.

1048
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And we watch it.

1049
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And there are certain moments that I go to again and again and again that I

1050
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
can't and I'm friends with a bunch of these guys.

1051
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So I will I will corner Will Arnett and say, why does it bother you if

1052
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
you're dancing as the magician, but Buster's dancing as well.

1053
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What bothers you that because he's often getting like, no, no, no, I do that.

1054
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But I'll just hound him all the time about that stuff.

1055
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And he's got answers.

1056
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yes, he's got answers.

1057
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So you've now hit a gusher twice.

1058
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And that implies that you had nothing to do with it because you did.

1059
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But you've had this great fortune.

1060
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And then I remember very clearly seeing, oh, there's going to be this movie

1061
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Grand Theft Auto and it's directed by Ron Howard.

1062
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Now, since then, we're very familiar with the idea of an on-camera person

1063
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
directing a film or right.

1064
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But I remember at the time thinking, what?

1065
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah, I felt that pressure because, you know, I mean, I was that I might as well

1066
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
have had that famous t-shirt.

1067
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What I really want to do is direct since I was about 14, you know, and I

1068
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
would and I would get the most sort of patronizing responses when I would

1069
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
admit it.

1070
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And but I but I also made the most out of those situations and I would hang

1071
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
with the directors and take notes and do all kinds of things.

1072
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And but but, you know, yeah, that was not a transition and particularly to

1073
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
have been a kid actor on a sitcom.

1074
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You know, the whole thing was it was ludicrous in people's minds.

1075
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So but you have a you must have a confidence because you knew on some

1076
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
level, you knew I got this.

1077
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yes, I did.

1078
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I really I mean, I mean, in fact, I started shooting Grand Theft Auto the day

1079
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
after my 23rd birthday, but I was disappointed because I had really

1080
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
planned to direct a feature while I was still in my teens.

1081
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That was my that was my goal.

1082
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You know, and but but you know, again, it was the business was so much

1083
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
more closed than and then there were and there were there was not even any like

1084
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
MTV or anything where you could go and prove your chops somewhere.

1085
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It was today.

1086
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
People can make a film using their phone.

1087
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You take this phone and you make something.

1088
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
People go, hey, that was and then you put it online.

1089
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And if you don't need to convince the studio, if it gets like this got like

1090
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
10 million likes, you're good.

1091
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Well, by the way, I just got a jump to the documentary that we're going to talk

1092
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
about Jim Henson.

1093
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I made a documentary about about Jim Henson and the Muppets.

1094
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And but he and his wife Jane were so much like young content creators of

1095
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
today.

1096
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yes, yes, because they they're the new medium, the new thing, the tech that

1097
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
was interesting to them was TV, which was just brand new.

1098
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And he wasn't even interested in puppets, but he loved television.

1099
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
He wanted to be a part of it.

1100
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
He was, you know, he was living in in Washington and he he went down there

1101
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and just kind of they looked for they were looking for a five minute puppet

1102
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
show to go with the news.

1103
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I mean, you know, but they were just experimenting with TV and he got in

1104
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
on the experiment along with Jane ultimately became his wife.

1105
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But you you look at these crazy little six second commercials they did and

1106
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
these little five minute bits they did for for after the news hour.

1107
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And it was so inventive.

1108
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And and it was all bets are off and just kind of whatever you want to do.

1109
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But they were doing they were getting their 10,000 hours in and they were

1110
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
doing what a content creator does now, which is find your voice, see if

1111
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
anybody's interested, figure out what they're interested in and and, you

1112
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
know, and go for there.

1113
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well, at that time, there was there was really no outlet like that for me.

1114
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I mean, I literally was thinking about going down to public access television

1115
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and trying to like do a show on public access television.

1116
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Getting the chance to direct a feature film.

1117
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Entertainment was so much smaller.

1118
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You said it was closed.

1119
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It was a very insular world.

1120
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yes.

1121
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
There's three networks.

1122
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Right.

1123
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
There's a couple of studios.

1124
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
They make the stuff.

1125
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
They decide who the people are.

1126
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And so very impossible to crack into that.

1127
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yeah.

1128
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And especially if they have a preconceived notion like I'm sorry,

1129
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
you're the guy from happy days and your OPI.

1130
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Now, I could have had a chance to direct happy days episodes in a contract

1131
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
renegotiation, but I said no to that because I didn't want anybody other than

1132
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Jerry Parris to direct.

1133
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It would be not fair to the cast.

1134
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And the other thing I thought was, well, what if I with, you know,

1135
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
every once in a while there an episode doesn't work.

1136
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yeah.

1137
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And if I do well, they say, well, it's this show.

1138
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
If I if I if I have a off episode, then why can't even direct his own show.

1139
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Right.

1140
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And it's three camera, not what I wanted to do.

1141
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But Roger Corman was one of the few people who was taking that kind of a risk.

1142
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And I knew that about him.

1143
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And he wanted me to act in a movie called Eat My Dust.

1144
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And I read Eat My Dust and I didn't much care for it.

1145
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I saw no Oscars in my, you know, no Oscar opportunities in that one.

1146
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But but but I did have a script that I'd written that was a kind of a slice of

1147
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
life about a guy over stuck over college break and, you know, in Hollywood.

1148
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And I had some short films.

1149
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I was supposed to go in and have this meeting about about Eat My Dust.

1150
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
American graffiti had been a big hit.

1151
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Happy Days was becoming a number one show.

1152
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And Roger wanted me to be in this in this car crash comedy.

1153
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And my agent was going to come with me to sit with me to have this meeting.

1154
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And he was my agent for like my whole childhood.

1155
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I and I remember saying, you can't you can't go in with me.

1156
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I was only I was only 21, but I knew I was going to try to barter.

1157
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah.

1158
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And he didn't care about that.

1159
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I knew he didn't care about that.

1160
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So I I I remember the look on his face.

1161
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
He was shattered.

1162
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You know, I mean, his clients said, no, don't go to the meeting.

1163
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So I went in, talked to Roger.

1164
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I said, you know, I don't love Eat My Dust.

1165
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But what I really want to do is direct.

1166
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Here's a script.

1167
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I think I've raised half the money coming out of Australia.

1168
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
150,000.

1169
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I needed another 150,000 in distribution.

1170
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And if you do that, then I'll happily be in Eat My Dust.

1171
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
He read it.

1172
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
He got back to me.

1173
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
He looked at my student films.

1174
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And he said, well, that's a character piece.

1175
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It's very well written, but it's not what I do.

1176
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And he said, here's what here's what I'll promise you.

1177
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
If you if you act and eat my dust, I'll give you a chance to write a script.

1178
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
If you write the script and I like it and you're willing to be in it again,

1179
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
then I'll let you direct that.

1180
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
If that fails, I'll let you direct the, you know, second unit on something

1181
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and the car crashes or the fights or something else.

1182
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So I thought, okay, so my big, I leveraged my way into a second unit job.

1183
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah.

1184
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That's going to look great on the resume, but I took it.

1185
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And when Eat My Dust succeeded, I went in and I pitched so many different ideas.

1186
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
A sci-fi thing, a noir thing, you know, just different kinds of projects.

1187
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And he smiled and he said, when we were testing, he was very erudite.

1188
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Right.

1189
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I remember him.

1190
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
He had been to Caltech and he was an engineering, you know, an engineer at heart.

1191
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
He said, when we were testing titles for Eat My Dust,

1192
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
there was another title that came in a very strong second.

1193
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Grand Theft Auto.

1194
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,000
If you can fashion a car crash comedy that we can correctly entitle, Grand Theft Auto.

1195
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'd probably make that picture.

1196
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Yeah.

1197
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And my dad and I cooked up an outline.

1198
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
We wrote a script in a month.

1199
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It was the fastest green light I've had in my entire career as a director.

1200
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Roger Corman passed, I believe, a week ago.

1201
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
A week ago, yes.

1202
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And age 98.

1203
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
98 years old.

1204
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So sharp.

1205
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I talked to him six months ago.

1206
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I mean, he went to see my 13 lives.

1207
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
He went to a screening.

1208
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yet, you know, he was so supportive of all of his graduates.

1209
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
He just remained so connected.

1210
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
We must have been incredibly proud of what you, you know, pulled off.

1211
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
He was proud of all of us.

1212
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
He was proud of all of us.

1213
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Jim Cameron, Joe Dante, Alan Arkesh, you know.

1214
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Hell, Francis Coppola and Scorsese.

1215
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Bogdanovic, the list goes on.

1216
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So I had this great treat yesterday, which is I'm told I get to see an advanced copy

1217
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
of Idea Man.

1218
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And I have a lot emotionally invested in this film because I have my own Jim Henson connection.

1219
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I watched the film and it's fantastic.

1220
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Oh, thank you.

1221
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It's a fantastic documentary.

1222
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So many things I learned about Jim Henson that I did not know.

1223
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Jim Henson, I didn't realize his background growing up in this Christian science.

1224
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
His mom's a Christian scientist.

1225
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
His mom's a Christian scientist.

1226
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah.

1227
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And he wasn't formally because he wasn't all that religious.

1228
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But of course, you know, he was raised in, you know, in that environment.

1229
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But he was creative.

1230
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
He was smart and he wanted to express himself.

1231
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And his dad was a bit of a scientist, like an agricultural scientist.

1232
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And so they would travel around to different parts of the country.

1233
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
A lot of it in the south.

1234
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But Jim, you know, was looking for that kind of breakthrough.

1235
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But it was a moment of transformation.

1236
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And he sees that opportunity.

1237
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
But it's interesting that he grabbed, wound up grabbing, you know, an ancient art form.

1238
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yes.

1239
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And elevating it.

1240
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
When I was a kid sitting around, we were talking about the Andy Griffith Show.

1241
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
One of the character actors who would come on that show would be bitching and moaning

1242
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
because radio was dead or vaudeville had gone.

1243
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And yet we all know that those mediums didn't vanish.

1244
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You know, there isn't a vaudeville circuit per se, but there's stand up.

1245
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
There's Cirque du Soleil.

1246
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
There's, you know, I mean, the art forms are as relevant as ever.

1247
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And I think you're so right Conan.

1248
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I just think creative people figure out a way.

1249
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
They find a way.

1250
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And what's fascinating to me is so Jim Henson is very interested in puppets, puppeteering.

1251
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And one of the things that he wants to do early on is and I hadn't thought of this before,

1252
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
but it's in your documentary.

1253
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
A lot of puppeteering was done just in kind of a wide shot where you see with the theater,

1254
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
with the with the with curtains and little curtains and the characters are all bashing

1255
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
each other and things are happening.

1256
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Jim Henson or his wife, Jane, but they understand that the TV camera has to be right up against

1257
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
the puppets.

1258
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Right.

1259
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Muppets and that so that you can see their expressions and you can see a character deflate.

1260
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And what's really fascinating to me is your look, you know, you have access in the documentary

1261
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
to all that early footage long before it's very sophisticated.

1262
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Right.

1263
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's basically Kermit, but they don't know it's Kermit yet.

1264
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Right.

1265
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Right.

1266
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But the kind of the puckering of the mouth.

1267
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yes.

1268
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
There's a little bit of uncertainty and the looking to the side and then the maybe looking

1269
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
back at the camera.

1270
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
All that stuff is there and it's in close up and they're looking at a basically looks

1271
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
like a kinescope.

1272
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Right.

1273
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The technology is very crude.

1274
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Right.

1275
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But you can see, oh my God, this guy.

1276
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
They're looking at the monitor and sort of seeing, well, where is the camera and where

1277
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
do I fit in?

1278
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah.

1279
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And but the timing on this stuff was just fantastic, you know.

1280
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah.

1281
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
We interviewed Frank Oz, you know, gave the family was great.

1282
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
They made the archives available, but also they made themselves available in a really

1283
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
in a really significant way.

1284
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And look, their storytellers themselves.

1285
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And so they, you know, they recognize the need to share what they understood about their

1286
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
parents, you know, in a dimensional way.

1287
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And so that was incredibly value.

1288
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
But Frank was there side by side and he gave so much to the movie through his interview.

1289
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
In fact, stylistically, you know, I tried to sort of channel Jim Henson and that aesthetic,

1290
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,000
a lot of stop motion, a lot of very kinetic cutting and some animations and things like

1291
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
that.

1292
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And the idea sort of stemmed first from me watching a lot of Jim's experimental movies

1293
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
that had nothing to do with puppets, which I didn't know about, by the way.

1294
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Me neither.

1295
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And they're cool, you know.

1296
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And in fact, they anticipate a lot of what you're going to eventually see in commercials

1297
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
or even music videos, right?

1298
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You know, I mean, they're kind of hard days night and stuff like that.

1299
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
You know, so Frank, we did the interview and I just had this idea.

1300
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
We did it in a cube because one of his experimental TV shows was called the cube.

1301
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And it's like a human being trapped sort of just with himself and his ideas and thoughts.

1302
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So we decided to have the interview subjects be in a cube.

1303
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It also would allow us to use those cubes.

1304
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
They're almost like television tests to keep putting a lot of visual imagery in there and

1305
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
keep telling this story of Jim and the Muppets.

1306
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But we did Frank's interview.

1307
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It was very moving, very informative, very funny.

1308
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And I said, you know, Frank, what if we did like, what if your entrance into the set?

1309
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
We were going to have you just come and sit down, but what if we did it stop motion?

1310
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And he, of course, instantly knew what to do.

1311
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So we put the camera up high.

1312
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
We had a chair kind of squiggle in, coming in and stop.

1313
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And he went in perfectly one take, laid out all the steps and all the beats so that we

1314
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
could do it.

1315
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And it just established immediately for the editor, your editors and myself that, you know,

1316
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
we were going to, we were going to inform this movie with this kind of aesthetic.

1317
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Well, also, you were having fun.

1318
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Yes.

1319
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Which is the essence of Jim Henson.

1320
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yes.

1321
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You know, my connection to it was that my whole reason I'm in comedy is I was always

1322
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
interested in comedy and doing it for my friends.

1323
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And then I decided I need to be serious.

1324
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So I go to a serious college, which turns out to have this very old humor magazine in

1325
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
it as part of it.

1326
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
The lamp, the Harvard lampoon.

1327
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I get on the lampoon and immediate, almost immediately the person who's put in charge

1328
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
of it, the first woman to ever be put in charge of it is Lisa Henson.

1329
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Oh, then she's my boss.

1330
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I'm working for Lisa Henson.

1331
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And then every now and then Jim Henson's around and I'm losing my mind.

1332
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I bet he could not have been a sweeter, nicer man.

1333
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And in fact, Lisa graduates, I take over the lampoon.

1334
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And at one point, Jim Henson calls me and says, Hey, we just finished the dark crystal and

1335
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
we have these thrones that the creatures sit on in the dark crystal.

1336
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Do you guys want one for your lampoon building?

1337
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Oh, you've never heard me say yes to anything more quickly.

1338
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And so I said, yes, how do I make this happen?

1339
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm still I'm just still a kid.

1340
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I'm like 19 and I'm going, yes, Mr. Henson.

1341
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So what do I, and he said, and it's funny, because when you're talking to Jim Henson, you're talking to Kermit.

1342
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Kermit, kind of, yeah.

1343
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So Kermit's on the other end of the line saying, well, you know, just get a van and come on down to New York and pick it up.

1344
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Yeah, idiot.

1345
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I'm like, OK, Kermit and Henson, bye.

1346
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So I hang up the phone.

1347
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:36,000
We rent a van and my friend Mark Anum and Maya Williams, we jump in this van and we drive down to Manhattan and I'm

1348
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
terrified.

1349
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
So I'm like, we're driving to Manhattan.

1350
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Suddenly it's like a Muppet movie.

1351
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Yeah.

1352
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And I'm kind of a Muppet.

1353
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And I'm like, what's happening?

1354
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And we get to stay out.

1355
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Yeah, exactly.

1356
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I'm beaker.

1357
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And we get there and sure enough, there's like Snufflevacus is hanging from the ceiling and they say, oh, yeah, here's the chair.

1358
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's made of it's not that heavy because it's made of this super light material.

1359
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
We carry it like a jewel.

1360
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And we put it in the back of the van.

1361
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
One of those chairs that they're, you know, at the studio.

1362
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yeah.

1363
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And I drove it all the way back to Cambridge and we put it in the Lampoon building.

1364
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So cut to, I don't know, like maybe nine months ago, I'm in Cambridge and a student comes up to me and says, hey, by the way, Conan, I'm on the Lampoon.

1365
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Do you want to come by?

1366
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And I went, yeah, sure.

1367
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I've been there in a long time.

1368
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So I go by and there's the chair.

1369
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Oh, great.

1370
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Little banged up.

1371
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1372
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Just they drink.

1373
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I mean, the puppet strength.

1374
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It was that way when we got it.

1375
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But anyway.

1376
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Amazing.

1377
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Well, Lisa's fantastic.

1378
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
She's amazing.

1379
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You know, and so is Bryant.

1380
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You know, the whole family.

1381
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Very talented.

1382
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But it's kind of a tribute to them because look, the reality is, and then when you see the film, we deal with the family.

1383
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Jim and Jane had an amazing, very unique and very specific kind of romance and relationship and working relationship.

1384
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And the very thing that brought them together was the birth of this brainchild, the Muppets.

1385
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Also was the thing that ultimately kind of caused the relationship to erode and the romance to be lost.

1386
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And yet they, there was still so much love and respect for one another and for creativity.

1387
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And the kids are great.

1388
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And the kids love each other and they appreciate their parents in a very honest, you know, clear-eyed way.

1389
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And they knew they couldn't make this documentary themselves.

1390
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You know, they're creative.

1391
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
They're producers and directors and so forth.

1392
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But I felt so fortunate that they would trust me.

1393
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And I got very excited about it when I went to the studio here, the Chaplin and Henson studio.

1394
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And saw all this archival stuff because two things happened on that day.

1395
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
One was, I saw those crazy TV commercials and that early, early stuff.

1396
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I saw the experimental stuff that's just weird and strange.

1397
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And yet you can see in forms.

1398
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Very avant-garde.

1399
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Very cutting edge, very ahead of its time.

1400
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:04,000
But you could see, you know, the way that it influenced the mainstream stuff that is so beloved that we all appreciate.

1401
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And yet, and I also got to talk to the kids and I recognized that there was this family story to be told as well.

1402
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That would be so relatable because there is, of course, there's a cost to that level of output.

1403
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And, you know, there's a human factor there.

1404
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And we're all the beneficiaries of all that hard work, but we didn't see all the things that he did that kind of misfired.

1405
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And at the time disappointed him, including Labyrinth, which of course now is a classic.

1406
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
You know, what's interesting is that you go back and you look at these moments.

1407
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And a lot of people forget this, but your documentary brings it back.

1408
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I was a writer at Saturday Night Live for a couple of years.

1409
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Then I'm doing the late night show and our studio was on the sixth floor.

1410
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Sonnet Live Studio is on the eighth floor.

1411
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:04,000
But right down the sixth floor, not far down the sixth floor, there was a little office because in the early days of SNL, the first season, Jim Henson, Frank Oz, they're doing the Muppets are part of SNL.

1412
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And they had a little office and they drew all of these characters on these pipes.

1413
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And now, of course, it's been put behind glass and preserved.

1414
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But in my day, you could just go by and there are some pipes there and they're just covered with those drawings.

1415
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Amazing.

1416
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I'm not trying to wipe them off, you know, because I like clean pipes.

1417
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I just think pipes should be clean.

1418
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
But I couldn't get them off.

1419
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But that was a misstep for them, right?

1420
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Because that kind of didn't work out.

1421
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:42,000
What's interesting is that all the cutting edge, cool, sardonic, you know, Michael O'Donoghue's, you know, Wise Ass is at first season SNL.

1422
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
We're like, these puppets, what are they?

1423
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
These puppets are here.

1424
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I hate these puppets.

1425
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And so it was very, you can tell in the documentary, crushing to Jim Henson.

1426
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And then he spirals off from that and creates the Muppet Show.

1427
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah.

1428
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But he'd been he'd been trying to sell the Muppet Show for years and failing.

1429
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I mean, all the networks turned it down twice.

1430
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:08,000
There's a hilarious pitch sort of video that they made that using the Muppets to sell the idea.

1431
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah.

1432
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And going completely over the top and it's Jim's voice.

1433
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And it's just it's just it's just brilliant.

1434
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You know, it's so interesting because Jim was, you know, you you got to really know him.

1435
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I met him only once, but it's so shy and retiring in person.

1436
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You know, I mean, just kind of and and you you think of him as a performer, but but not not with a microphone, not not with a camera on his face.

1437
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's through the puppets.

1438
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Yeah.

1439
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
We were talking about Andy and Don, but I it became so clear, not even so much from the interview with Frank Oz.

1440
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Because he was very modest about his contributions.

1441
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
But as I began to recognize and look at these videos, what a comedy team they were.

1442
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yes.

1443
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Not just Burton Ernie, but but you know, Miss Piggy and Kermit.

1444
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
There's a great bit in there with Fawzi and Kermit.

1445
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And this is timing.

1446
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I mean, it's like precision comedy timing and they just nailed these bits.

1447
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Well, I think that's the thing is good comedy is good comedy.

1448
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So if you're making it for kids on PBS or you're making it, you know, for adults, good timing is good timing.

1449
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That's why I mean, I I always got my timing from early on from Warner Brothers cartoons.

1450
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Because yeah, they were shown his shorts in theaters to adults.

1451
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
They weren't condescending.

1452
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Right.

1453
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So the timing was pitch perfect on those.

1454
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah.

1455
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And then I think the same thing with when you look at a really good Sesame Street bit.

1456
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's just good.

1457
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah.

1458
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
There's no condescension of, well, this is funny for kids.

1459
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
But I didn't realize how many of those bits that Jim directed.

1460
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I just thought he, you know, he brought them up.

1461
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It's and performed and they did that.

1462
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And I didn't realize that all those bits that used to catch my attention when three year old Bryce was watching them.

1463
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yeah.

1464
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Were the counting bits and these great experimental things that would make me sit down and watch the show and kind of admire what was going on there and envy it a little bit.

1465
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And I later I realized, well, that's that was one of the one of the reasons Jim did it because he never wanted to do kids programming.

1466
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
But they said, you know, bring them up.

1467
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's but we'll also let you do your experimental films.

1468
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
But how about doing them for kids so that they can learn and and he had a he had a son with severe learning disabilities.

1469
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So that was something that he was, you know, clued into.

1470
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And he was once you say that the reason it really worked at every level was that he was really a satirist, right?

1471
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Oh, definitely.

1472
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It's always there.

1473
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
What's interesting is that the early way that he made money was by making television commercials.

1474
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So there are these Muppet commercials that I don't know if you've seen them, but they're in black and white.

1475
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And it's before anyone knew they were the Muppets.

1476
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
But it's you can tell it's the same kind of almost the same characters, but they're prototypes.

1477
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But they're doing like Hormel Ham commercials.

1478
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
But they're very and they had they last like seven seconds long.

1479
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
But because they're seven seconds long, they're very meta.

1480
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Right.

1481
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Very today's sense of comedy.

1482
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah.

1483
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
They're not by a Hormel Ham.

1484
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:04,000
They're they're they're they're very weird and very funny by today's standards and must have looked like very strange at the time.

1485
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And yet really popular.

1486
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah.

1487
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
So they really, really broke through.

1488
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I mean, they were doing some kind of, I mean, there was almost always an explosion or a gunshot and a Hormel Ham commercial somehow.

1489
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
They're making bacon.

1490
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They're selling.

1491
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
They're pretty much selling anything.

1492
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But they're doing ads the way we as part of the podcast, we do ads and I always do them in my sensibility, my way.

1493
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And then afterwards think no one's going to pay for that.

1494
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Right.

1495
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And they do.

1496
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah.

1497
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And you can leave this in.

1498
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I don't think they should.

1499
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
But they do.

1500
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Adam Sacks is going to take that out.

1501
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
But but because they see the value of we found out that they like that people listen to the ads.

1502
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yeah.

1503
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah.

1504
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I mean, they were, look, they were emotional without being sentimental.

1505
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah.

1506
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Definitely always had a point of view and always had something to say, you know, in and around the zaniness.

1507
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But the Muppet Show, you know, I didn't think about it.

1508
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I loved watching it.

1509
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Yeah.

1510
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I didn't watch them, you know, religiously.

1511
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But man, I'm, I watch them now.

1512
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah.

1513
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I mean, those episodes hold up, but I didn't realize that he was, he was basically taking the English dance hall sort of almost like

1514
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Vodville, their version and applying that to the show.

1515
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And he's making them in England.

1516
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah.

1517
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So it's sort of once again, what's all this new when put through this filter.

1518
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
You mentioned earlier, I knew Jim Well, and I can't say I did.

1519
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I met him on a few occasions and he was really nice.

1520
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And he actually suggested he had some show that probably never went.

1521
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And it was towards the end of his life, but suggested that I because people were always like that Conan's got like a look or something.

1522
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yeah.

1523
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
He's irritating, but he's got a look.

1524
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And Jim Henson suggested that I auditioned for something for one of his shows.

1525
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And I remember they sent over, I've told this, but they sent, they sent over sides that had two actors, two characters.

1526
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And I didn't know which one he wanted me to audition for.

1527
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Right.

1528
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:07,000
So I showed up at the end and said to the woman who was running the audition, it says, Steve and Mitch and I don't know which is which.

1529
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And she said, oh, here's the character breakdowns.

1530
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And she handed me Steve and it said, women want to be with him and want to be him.

1531
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
He oozes sexuality.

1532
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And I was just like deflating.

1533
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And then I said, I said, can I see the one for Mitch?

1534
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And she had any Mitch was like this gangly, goofy red topped goon stumbles his way through life.

1535
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But people like him, despite his many flaws and his asexuality.

1536
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And I went, I think I'm the second guy.

1537
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
No, this is a lovely tribute.

1538
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And one of the things that really got to me is because of my connection when Jim passed very suddenly in 1990.

1539
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And it was such a shock because it was just out of nowhere.

1540
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
He gets this 53 years old.

1541
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
53 years old.

1542
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I was invited to that memorial.

1543
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And to this day, it's the greatest send off I've seen anybody have because it's a funeral.

1544
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
It's a funeral mass.

1545
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's a memorial.

1546
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And it started with, I guess, a letter from Jim that he had written, which is like, well, if you're reading this, it must mean I'm gone.

1547
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Right.

1548
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And he just decided to write this in case he ever passed suddenly.

1549
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And he did.

1550
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And it was so lovely.

1551
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And then all the characters come out and we're all laughing and crying at the same time.

1552
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So you show footage of the memorial service and I was there.

1553
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Yeah.

1554
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And I to this day have thought, that's what everyone should be like.

1555
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It can't be because we're not all Jim Henson, you know, but that's what it should be.

1556
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It really should be a celebration.

1557
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Well, it clearly was.

1558
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And, you know, his son, Brian, read that letter.

1559
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And we have a bit of that in the.

1560
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Oh, my God.

1561
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
It was a tremendous tribute and moment.

1562
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
But he's so loved.

1563
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I mean, everybody we interviewed, it was actually great to make a film that I thought was interesting, could be revealing.

1564
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And actually just doesn't have a dark side.

1565
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I mean, it's just that he literally was just a guy who lived in a positive light and struggled ups and downs.

1566
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Difficulties on a personal side, but in the relationship, sure.

1567
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And yet set such a great, you know, example, how you navigate that too.

1568
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I mean, when it's easy, but when you struggle, that defines the man or the woman and you look at both Jim and Jane.

1569
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah.

1570
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And you sort of say, well, that's, you know, we should we should do that.

1571
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The documentary is atomic.

1572
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I would recommend just just watch it because you will laugh very hard.

1573
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But it's also informative about so much more.

1574
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:50,000
You're the right guy to make this because I think because because you have just in every single decade of your life contributed good stuff.

1575
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
You know, and I think that's who can say that?

1576
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's really remarkable.

1577
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
You know, and I'm so glad that you're here.

1578
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I'm so glad I know you.

1579
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm so glad you let me saw your arm off 30 years ago.

1580
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
And we're still at it.

1581
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
We're still going.

1582
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah.

1583
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Let's do a leg.

1584
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Yeah.

1585
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Oh, I checked out his leg on the way.

1586
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
That left one looks like it could go anytime.
